Slugbotics is a student organization at UC Santa Cruz focused on introducing
students to hands-on robotics engineering, founded in 2017. In the 2018-2019
school year, our team designed, fabricated, and programmed BIG SLAB, our
second ROV, capable of performing various tasks in the MATE competition
including object dispersion and manipulation, water quality sensing,
and autonomous analysis. Since then, we continue to grow and learn, tackling
new projects, and introducing others to the field of robotics.
