Slugbotics is a student organization at UC Santa Cruz focused on introducing
students to hands-on robotics engineering, founded in 2017. In the 2018-2019
school year, our team designed, fabricated, and programmed BIG SLAB. Our second
ROV, BIG SLAB is capable of performing various tasks in the MATE competition
including object deployment and manipulation, water quality sensing, and
autonomous analysis. Since then, we have continued to grow and learn, tackling
new projects, and introducing others to the field of robotics.

## Organization

Slugbotics is organized as a student organization under the Electrical and
Computer Engineering (ECE) Department, in partnership with the Cyber-Physical
Systems Research Center (CPSRC) and the UCSCâ€™s Sustainability Lab (S-lab). Our
connections enable us to give students access to resources such as machining and
electronics equipment that would otherwise be out of reach, and by doing so
present them an opportunity to gain hands-on engineering experience.

New members are accepted at the beginning of Fall Quarter, where we lead them
through an onboarding process which teaches all necessary skills to contribute
to the team - such as CAD, electronics, and embedded programming.
