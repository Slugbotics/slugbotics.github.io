# Join Slugbotics
We're glad that you're interested in joining our team! Here at Slugbotics, we
wish to bring every aspiring engineer into the field of robotics, regardless
of background. To do this, we accept new members every Fall quarter, and 
provide relevant trainings and onboardings to give every member the skills they
need to build robots, regardless of previous experience. This also means we 
don't gate admission into the team based on any kind of academic ability or 
prior participation - all who are willing to learn, participate, and 
contribute are welcome.

# Roles
Slugbotics is divided into several different major roles, each of which
contributes to the development of our robots, and the team itself.

{{<image-banner "/images/join/mechanical.jpg">}}
## Mechanical
**FRC Equivalent: CAD, Design**

The Mechanical role leads designing the various physical components of the ROV,
from frame design, to attachment and directing of motors, to geared mechanisms,
and test props. We design these parts using CAD (computer assisted design)
software, and fabricate them using 3D printers and other machines. We also test
different designs through extensive prototyping and hands-on experimentation.

On the Mechanical subteam, you will learn the basics of modelling and design
using SOLIDWORKS, as well as work to create simple and effective designs which
reduce the complexity needed across the ROV. You'll also learn how to fabricate
different parts using various tools and machines. These skills are seldom
offered in courses - UCSC lacks a mechanical engineering department - so the
work done here is something you can't get anywhere else at UCSC.

We recommend this subteam for hands-on experience with building robots, and for
those interested in complementing their studies with knowledge of mechanics.

## Electronics
**FRC Equivalent: Electrical**

The Electronics role leads designing the various electrical components on the
ROV, including sensor layouts, power conversion, network wiring, motor control,
cameras, and more. We design these parts using circuit design software, and
prototype them through a combination of hands-on testing and circuit analysis.

On the Electronics subteam, you'll learn the basics of circuit design using
EAGLE, and create electrical designs which wire the different components of the
ROV together, while meeting constraints such as thermal limits. You'll also
learn the basics of hands-on electronics construction, such as soldering,
crimping, and waterproofing.

We recommend this subteam for experience in designing hardware and learning the
basics of Electrical Engineering. We also recommend this subteam for programmers
interested in complementing a knowledge of software systems with the underlying
hardware.

## Systems
**FRC Equivalent: Software, Auto, Programming, Coding**

The Systems role leads programming the electronic systems of the ROV to
accomplish various tasks. This role is broad, including tasks such as Systems
Administration, embedded microcontroller programming, GUI Application
Development, Computer Vision, networking, and autonomous decision-making. This
role also works closely with the Electronics role, helping to implement the
logic which connects the different devices onboard.

On the Systems subteam, you'll learn a broad set of skills relating to computer
systems and programming, and apply them to create better systems for the ROV.
You'll also learn the basics of robotics systems, including basics of topics
such as Computer Vision (not offered as an undergraduate course at UCSC).

We recommend the Systems subteam to those who are interested in learning how to
apply their programming skills to robotics using UNIX, OpenCV, and Qt. You'll
also learn embedded programming skills, including working with Arduino and
microcontrollers, for integrating software into robotics projects.

## Formula 1/10
**FRC Equivalent: Auto**

In addition to participating in the MATE competition, we also have a branch of
our team dedicated to the Formula 1/10 Competition, in collaboration with the
Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (CPSRC). This competition involves
programming a miniature racecar to drive at top speeds across a track, using
technologies such as ML (neural networks) and LIDAR. You'll learn how to apply
different advanced technologies, from computer vision to deep learning.

We recommend joining this division if you're interested in learning the advanced
technologies which drive autonomous robotics, particularly in the context of cars. It also offers an exciting
opportunity to learn from graduate students and faculty about technologies used
in robotics and control research.

## SOMARS
**FRC Equivalent: Auto**

In partnership with CITRIS and professor Steve McGuire, we now have a new branch of our team dedicated to autonomous robotics, focusing on autonomous robotics and control
challenges for the CITRIS competitions. This gives members an opportunity to 
compete against other CITRIS teams from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Merced. This
year's competition, the CITRIS Aviation Prize, will focus on designing and
developing a long-range UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).

We recommend joining this division if you're interested in autonomous competitions,
as well as interacting and learning from faculty and the CITRIS Institute.

For more information, see the [SOMARS Project Page]({{< ref "/projects/somars">}})

{{<image-banner "/images/join/busicrop.jpg">}}
## Finance
**FRC Equivalent: Business, Outreach**

The Finance subteam manages various aspects of the team, including handling team
finances, sourcing sponsorships, interacting with other organizations at UCSC,
and making contributions to the future of the team.

On the Finance subteam, you'll learn how to lead and manage projects, as well as
make contributions to furthering the team's capabilities and to policy decisions
within the team.

{{<image-banner "/images/join/outban.jpg">}}
## Outreach
**FRC Equivalent: Outreach**

The Outreach subteam helps to connect the team both to the local campus
community, as well as to the surrounding community of Santa Cruz, to help attach
students to robotics learning opportunities. Outreach's goal is to introduce a
broad community to robotics and engineering, from K-12 students to other
students at Santa Cruz.

On the Outreach subteam, you'll work to create projects and events to introduce
a broad set of students to robotics.

# How to Join
The link below will take you to a Google form where you can register your
interest for the team. Once you register your interest, you will be given a link
on the form that will allow you to sign up for our Slack. Slack is a group
messaging platform that we use to communicate on Slugbotics. This will let you
get in touch with us, as well as others joining the team!

If you submitted the form but did not get a link (or clicked past it), we will
send you an invite via email within 24 hours of your submission.

## Introductory Meetings
Two introductory meetings will be held. One will be in person at UC Santa Cruz,
and the other will be remote, to accomodate everyone regardless of living
situation. Both meetings will contain the same content, so you do not need to
attend both - instead, pick whichever one is more convenient for you.

### Remote Meeting
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 @ 7PM, on Zoom.

*Zoom link TBA.*

### In-person meeting
Saturday, September 25 2021 @ 3-4 PM, at E2-180 (The Simularium).

To find the Simularium, go to outside of the Engineering 2, and find the
large room to the bottom right of Engineering 2 (facing the front of the 
building from Baskin Engineering). It will be located on the first floor,
in the separate buildings, below the second floor (which houses the open
counters)
