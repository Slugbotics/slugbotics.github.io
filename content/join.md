# Join Slugbotics
We're glad that you're interested in joining our team! Here at Slugbotics, we
wish to bring every aspiring engineer into the field of robotics, regardless
of background. To do this, we accept new members every Fall quarter, and 
provide relevant trainings and onboardings to give every member the skills they
need to build robots, regardless of previous experience. This also means we 
don't gate admission into the team based on any kind of academic ability or 
prior participation - all who are willing to learn, participate, and 
contribute are welcome.

# Roles
Slugbotics is divided into several different major roles, each of which
contributes to the development of our robots, and the team itself.

{{<image-banner "/images/join/mechanical.jpg">}}
## Mechanical
**FRC Equivalent: CAD, Design**

The Mechanical role leads designing the various physical components of the ROV,
from frame design, to attachment and directing of motors, to geared mechanisms,
and test props. We design these parts using CAD (computer assisted design)
software, and fabricate them using 3D printers and other machines. We also test
different designs through extensive prototyping and hands-on experimentation.

On the Mechanical subteam, you will learn the basics of modelling and design
using SOLIDWORKS, as well as work to create simple and effective designs which
reduce the complexity needed across the ROV. You'll also learn how to fabricate
different parts using various tools and machines. These skills are seldom
offered in courses - UCSC lacks a mechanical engineering department - so the
work done here is something you can't get anywhere else at UCSC.

We recommend this subteam for hands-on experience with building robots, and for
those interested in complementing their studies with knowledge of mechanics.

## Electronics
**FRC Equivalent: Electrical**

The Electronics role leads designing the various electrical components on the
ROV, including sensor layouts, power conversion, network wiring, motor control,
cameras, and more. We design these parts using circuit design software, and
prototype them through a combination of hands-on testing and circuit analysis.

On the Electronics subteam, you'll learn the basics of circuit design using
EAGLE, and create electrical designs which wire the different components of the
ROV together, while meeting constraints such as thermal limits. You'll also
learn the basics of hands-on electronics construction, such as soldering,
crimping, and waterproofing.

We recommend this subteam for experience in designing hardware and learning the
basics of Electrical Engineering. We also recommend this subteam for programmers
interested in complementing a knowledge of software systems with the underlying
hardware.

## Systems
**FRC Equivalent: Software, Auto, Programming, Coding**

The Systems role leads programming the electronic systems of the ROV to
accomplish various tasks. This role is broad, including tasks such as Systems
Administration, embedded microcontroller programming, GUI Application
Development, Computer Vision, networking, and autonomous decision-making. This
role also works closely with the Electronics role, helping to implement the
logic which connects the different devices onboard.

On the Systems subteam, you'll learn a broad set of skills relating to computer
systems and programming, and apply them to create better systems for the ROV.
You'll also learn the basics of robotics systems, including basics of topics
such as Computer Vision (not offered as an undergraduate course at UCSC).

We recommend the Systems subteam to those who are interested in learning how to
apply their programming skills to robotics using UNIX, OpenCV, and Qt. You'll
also learn embedded programming skills, including working with Arduino and
microcontrollers, for integrating software into robotics projects.

## Formula 1/10
**FRC Equivalent: Auto**

In addition to participating in the MATE competition, we also have a branch of
our team dedicated to the Formula 1/10 Competition, in collaboration with the
Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (CPSRC). This competition involves
programming a miniature racecar to drive at top speeds across a track, using
technologies such as ML (neural networks) and LIDAR. You'll learn how to apply
different advanced technologies, from computer vision to deep learning.

We recommend joining this division if you're interested in learning the advanced
technologies which drive autonomous robotics. It also offers an exciting
opportunity to learn from graduate students and faculty about technologies used
in robotics and control research.

For more information, see the [Formula 1/10 Project Page]({{< ref "/projects/formula1tenth">}})

## Finance
**FRC Equivalent: Business, Outreach**

The Finance subteam manages various aspects of the team, including handling team
finances, sourcing sponsorships, interacting with other organizations at UCSC,
and making contributions to the future of the team.

On the Finance subteam, you'll learn how to lead and manage projects, as well as
make contributions to furthering the team's capabilities and to policy decisions
within the team.

## Outreach
**FRC Equivalent: Outreach**

The Outreach subteam helps to connect the team both to the local campus
community, as well as to the surrounding community of Santa Cruz, to help attach
students to robotics learning opportunities. Outreach's goal is to introduce a
broad community to robotics and engineering, from K-12 students to other
students at Santa Cruz.

On the Outreach subteam, you'll work to create projects and events to introduce
a broad set of students to robotics.

# How to Join
We take in new members at the beginning of Fall quarter. We've concluded
recruiting new members for this year, and will take in more members for
onboarding in Fall 2021.

and would like to try and join our team, contact us at
