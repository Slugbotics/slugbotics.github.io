At Slugbotics, we aim to bring everyone into the fold of robotics. This means
going above and beyond UCSC students participating in our teams, and branching
out to introduce others in our community to the awesome potential of robotics.

# MATE Regional Competitions

Slugbotics assists MATE teams at the regional level, working with middle and
high school teams to deploy and debug their ROVs, as well as scoring the
competition. This assistance helps teams learn practices from college-level
students on our team, as well as helps prepare them to compete in more advanced
competitions, such as at the International level.

Slugboticsâ€™s location in Santa Cruz County helps us assist a wide variety of
MATE teams at surrounding schools and competitions, such as Aptos High at the
Monterey regional competition.

# Hands-On Robotics Activities

Slugbotics also aims to reach out to local grade schools in order to give young
students experience with robotics, and encourage them to pursue a career in
engineering. Currently, Slugbotics is developing several hands-on robotics
activities, which can be used in activities to introduce students to solving
puzzles through assembling robots. 

# Community Events

Slugbotics participates in many maker events in the surrounding community, such
as the Bay Area Maker Faire, Baskin Day, and more. Through our participation in
events, we represent the UCSC community, and drive engagement with student
organizations and our school of engineering.
