SOMARS is a sub-team of Slugbotics focused on autonomous robotics competitions.
The sub-team was spawned based off the 2021 FAA Challenge competition, with its
namesake deriving from the submission to the competition (System for the Oversight and Management
of Autonomous Robotics Systems). It now works in collaboration with the CITRIS
Institute and professor Steve McGuire, competing in CITRIS competitions against
teams from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Merced.

Our current project is the CITRIS Aviation Prize, a competition in which teams design and develop
an UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) capable of traveling 115 miles and performing multi-acre
environmental surveys.
