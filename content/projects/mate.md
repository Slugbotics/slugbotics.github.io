# What is MATE?

The MATE (Marine Advanced Technical Education) Competition is an underwater
robotics competition in which students create remotely operated underwater
vehicles (ROVs) which are capable of performing a variety of tasks. Teams work
to design, build, and test ROVs to perform various tasks, through mechanical,
electrical, and programming work, and take their finished ROV to competition.

For more information, see 
[the official MATE website.](https://www.materovcompetition.org)

# How does the MATE Competition work? 

Each November, the MATE Competition releases
a manual detailing the tasks that each teamâ€™s ROV must complete. MATE Teams
construct ROVs to accomplish wide varieties of tasks, from object manipulation
and signal sending, to autonomous navigation. Through mechanical, electrical,
and software engineering, teams develop their ROVs over Winter and Spring
quarter, before taking it to competition the following June.

# What skills do students gain through MATE?

Through the MATE Competition, students gain experience in everything from
mechanical design and fabrication, integrating electronic circuitry to drive
each component, and developing software which controls and automates different
aspects of the ROV. In addition, teams must also document design decisions,
prototypes, and even budgets to be compiled into a robust technical
documentation packet. These tasks give students a competitive edge in
engineering, project design, management, testing, marketing, and more. Students
gain experience on Slugbotics that no lecture hall can offer.
