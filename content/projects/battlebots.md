Starting 2021, Slugbotics has a new sub-team focusing on Combat robotics competitions. 
Our ultimate goal is to potentially get into the televised show Battle Bots.

# Slugger

Slugger is our first robot created to compete in the NRL Sacramento Bot Battles 
regional competition. We learned valuable information about how to create and plan to
build a battle bot and it helped shaped our expectations for the future.

We were successfully able to compete in the 2022 Sacramento Bot Battles and fight 2 teams there. One team we beat was Team Flagship from UCLA.
Here is a youtube video of the competition!

We will use everything we have learned from this year's competition and advice we have received to build a better bot in the future!
