## What is MATE?
MATE is an underwater robotics competition in which students create remotely
operated vehicles, or ROVs, which are capable of performing various tasks.
Teams work to design, build, and test ROVs to perform various tasks, through
mechanical, electrical, and programming work, and take their finished
ROV to competition.
