# Giving Day 2020
On September 30th, UC Santa Cruz is hosting its annual Giving Day, where
student organizations from around campus work to collect donations for their
group during a 24-hour period. Despite the challenges presented to our team this
year, Slugbotics is committed to continuing teaching of new students through our
onboarding program, as well as development of its MATE Competition ROV, Formula
1/10 autonomous car, and outreach projects. We hope to gain your financial
support to be able to continue making progress on these projects through these
challenging times.

To maximize your impact, make your donation from 5PM-7PM, to help Slugbotics
potentially win bonus funding from the University. Even the minimum donation of
$10 helps our team massively towards obtaining this crucial bonus funding.

Giving Day donations are tax-deductible, and will be credited on our website as
a token of thanks for your support. In addition, the Electrical and Computer
Engineering department at UCSC is matching us in $300 of funding this year. We
hope to have your support in continuing to push forward the many exciting
aspects of our growing organization, and help support student engineering at UC
Santa Cruz.
