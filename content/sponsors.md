# Giving Day 2020
On September 30th, UC Santa Cruz will be hosting its annual Giving Day, where student
organizations from around campus work to collect donations for their group during a 24-hour period. Despite the challenges presented to our team this year, Slugbotics is committed to continuing teaching of new students through our onboarding program, as well as development of its MATE Competition ROV, Formula 1/10 autonomous car, and outreach projects. We hope to gain your financial support to be able to continue making progress on these projects through these challenging times.

Giving Day donations are tax-deductible, and will be credited on our website as a token of thanks for your support. We hope to have your support in continuing to push forward the many exciting aspects of our growing organization, and help support student engineering at UC Santa Cruz.
