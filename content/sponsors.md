<!-- # Giving Day 2021 -->
On November 3rd, UC Santa Cruz is hosting its annual Giving Day, where student
organizations from around campus work to collect donations for their group
during a 24-hour period. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Slugbotics is
continuing to teach new students skills through onboarding, as well as develop
its MATE Competition ROV, Formula 1/10 autonomous car, SOMARS autonomous
projects, and outreach. We hope to gain your financial support to be able to
continue making progress on these fronts, and to support our growing team and
new leadership this year.

To maximize your impact, make your donation from 12PM-2PM, to help Slugbotics
potentially win bonus funding from the University. Even the minimum donation of
$10 helps our team massively towards obtaining this crucial bonus funding.

Giving Day donations are tax-deductible, and will be credited on our website as
a token of thanks. We hope to have your support in continuing to push forward
the many exciting aspects of our growing organization, and help support student
engineering at UC Santa Cruz.
