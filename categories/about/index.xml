&lt;p>Originally, this team was focused on competing in the F1Tenth competition for autonomous racing, but now we have pivoted to working on Autonomous Driving research.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="what-do-we-research">What do we research?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We are currently researching the use of Spiking Neural Networks with Prof. Jason Eshragian, and using Deep Reinforcement Learning and LLMs to create more robust and explainable driving models with Prof. Leilani Gilpin. Currently we are learning to use the nuScenes dataset to train a simple lane-following model which we can then test on our 1/10th scale autonomous car.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MATE</title><link>https://slugbotics.com/projects/mate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slugbotics.com/projects/mate/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="what-is-mate">What is MATE?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The MATE (Marine Advanced Technical Education) Competition is an underwater
robotics competition in which students create remotely operated underwater
vehicles (ROVs) which are capable of performing a variety of tasks. Teams work
to design, build, and test ROVs to perform various tasks, through mechanical,
electrical, and programming work, and take their finished ROV to competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more information, see
&lt;a href="https://www.materovcompetition.org">the official MATE website.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-does-the-mate-competition-work">How does the MATE Competition work?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Each November, the MATE Competition releases
a manual detailing the tasks that each teamâ€™s ROV must complete. MATE Teams
construct ROVs to accomplish wide varieties of tasks, from object manipulation
and signal sending, to autonomous navigation. Through mechanical, electrical,
and software engineering, teams develop their ROVs over Winter and Spring
quarter, before taking it to competition the following June.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SOMARS</title><link>https://slugbotics.com/projects/somars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slugbotics.com/projects/somars/</guid><description>&lt;/div>

&lt;p>SOMARS is a sub-team of Slugbotics focused on autonomous robotics competitions.
The sub-team was spawned based off the 2021 FAA Challenge competition, with its
namesake deriving from the submission to the competition (System for the Oversight and Management
of Autonomous Robotics Systems). It now works in collaboration with the CITRIS
Institute and professor Steve McGuire, competing in CITRIS competitions against
teams from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Merced.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
