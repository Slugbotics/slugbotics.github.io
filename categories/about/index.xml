F1TENTH is an autonomous robotics competition in which teams compete by developing self-driving algorithms for a one-tenth scale autonomous racecar. Since teams use the same cars, the competition is centered around optimizing these algorithms to navigate around a randomized racetrack in minimum time. In partnership with UCSCâ€™s Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center, Slugbotics members in the F1TENTH competition apply technologies such as LIDAR/SLAM, ROS, Rviz, and Gazebo to develop their car.</description></item><item><title>MATE</title><link>https://slugbotics.com/projects/mate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slugbotics.com/projects/mate/</guid><description>What is MATE? The MATE (Marine Advanced Technical Education) Competition is an underwater robotics competition in which students create remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) which are capable of performing a variety of tasks. Teams work to design, build, and test ROVs to perform various tasks, through mechanical, electrical, and programming work, and take their finished ROV to competition.
For more information, see the official MATE website.
How does the MATE Competition work?</description></item><item><title>SOMARS</title><link>https://slugbotics.com/projects/somars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slugbotics.com/projects/somars/</guid><description>SOMARS is a sub-team of Slugbotics focused on autonomous robotics competitions. The sub-team was spawned based off the 2021 FAA Challenge competition, with its namesake deriving from the submission to the competition (System for the Oversight and Management of Autonomous Robotics Systems). It now works in collaboration with the CITRIS Institute and professor Steve McGuire, competing in CITRIS competitions against teams from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Merced.</description></item></channel></rss>
